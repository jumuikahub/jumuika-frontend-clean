            <p>
              By using {BRAND_NAME}, you agree to these terms. We provide a

            <h3>Acceptable use</h3>
            <p>
              Use the platform lawfully and respectfully. Do not abuse,
              spam, or misrepresent services or identity.

              agreements.
